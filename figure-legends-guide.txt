FIGURE LEGENDS AND DESCRIPTIONS BEST PRACTICES

Based on "A Quick Fix for Figure Legends and Table Headings" guidance for creating effective educational figure descriptions.

=== FIGURE LEGEND PRINCIPLES ===

Primary Purpose:
- Make figures accessible to all students including those with visual impairments
- Provide context that helps students interpret data and understand concepts
- Support learning objectives through clear, structured descriptions

Core Requirements:
- Figure legends should be comprehensive yet concise
- Include both visual elements and conceptual significance
- Connect visual information to educational goals

=== WRITING EFFECTIVE FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS ===

Structure:
1. Start directly with scientific content and main finding (NEVER with "Figure")
2. Describe key data patterns and relationships
3. Explain educational significance or scientific meaning
4. Include specific data points when relevant for learning

Language Guidelines:
- Use descriptive, specific language
- Avoid vague terms like "shows" or "depicts" without detail
- Include quantitative information when educationally relevant
- Connect visual elements to course concepts

Examples of Effective Descriptions:
- "Line graph comparing enzyme activity rates across temperature ranges from 20 to 80 degrees Celsius, showing optimal activity at 37 degrees"
- "Molecular diagram illustrating hydrogen bonding between water molecules, with dashed lines indicating bond formations"
- "Scatter plot demonstrating positive correlation between study hours and test scores across 100 students"

=== ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS ===

Screen Reader Compatibility:
- Write descriptions that work well when read aloud
- Include spatial relationships (left, right, above, below)
- Specify colors only when educationally significant
- Describe patterns, trends, and distributions clearly

Educational Context:
- Align descriptions with learning objectives
- Emphasize conceptual understanding over purely visual details
- Include units of measurement and scale information
- Connect to broader course themes and concepts

=== QUALITY STANDARDS ===

Completeness Check:
- Can a student understand the figure's educational purpose from description alone?
- Are key data relationships clearly explained?
- Is the connection to course content evident?
- Would this description support assessment and learning goals?

Technical Accuracy:
- Verify all numerical data and units
- Ensure scientific terminology is correct
- Check that spatial relationships are accurately described
- Confirm alignment with textbook and course standards
