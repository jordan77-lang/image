SAMPLE ASSIGNMENT: ARCHIVAL FILM FORENSICS LAB

Course: Forensic Science 201 (College Introductory)
Duration: 2 weeks
Assessment: Lab report + identification challenge

OVERVIEW:
Students will analyze forensic evidence from historical archival film to determine material composition. Using density measurements, flame tests, and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), students will identify the polymer base and metallic compounds present in film samples.

BACKGROUND CONCEPTS:
- Atomic bonding (ionic, covalent, metallic)
- Polymer structures: polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) vs cellulose
- Molecular packing and density calculations
- Flame emission spectroscopy and metal ion identification
- Ion mobility spectrometry principles and data interpretation

LAB PROCEDURES:

Part 1: Polymer Identification
Students will measure the mass and volume (via water displacement) of film samples to calculate density. By comparing calculated densities to reference values, students will determine whether the base is PETE or cellulose acetate.

Part 2: Metal Ion Identification
Students will conduct flame tests on dissolved film samples. Different metal ions produce characteristic flame colors:
- Silver (Ag): produces white/gray flame
- Barium (Ba): produces green flame
Students will match observed colors to metals in silver halide and barium ferrite compounds used in archival film.

Part 3: IMS Analysis
Students will analyze ion mobility spectra to identify chemical compounds based on drift time. Peak height indicates relative abundance. Students will use reference drift times to identify accelerants and other compounds in film samples.

FINAL CHALLENGE:
Using all three analysis methods, students must determine which combination of polymer base and metallic compound matches the composition of a historic archival film sample from the 1940s.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
By completing this lab, students should be able to:
- Understand chemical bonding in polymers and metals
