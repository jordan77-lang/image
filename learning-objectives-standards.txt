LEARNING OBJECTIVES GENERATION STANDARDS
=========================================

CORE PRINCIPLES FOR HIGH-QUALITY LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. STUDENT-CENTERED FOCUS
   - Objectives must describe what STUDENTS will accomplish, not what instructors will teach
   - Use phrasing: "Students will be able to..." or "Learners will..."
   - Avoid: "Teach X," "Cover Y," "Introduce Z"

6. GENERALIZE BEYOND SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT ITEMS
   - Objectives should describe the skill or concept assessed, not the specific item, example, or subject used in the assessment
   - Focus on the cognitive process and underlying concept
   - Avoid referencing specific assessment items, questions, or examples directly
   - Example:
     ✗ "Predict which polymer has higher density based on molecular structure."
     ✓ "Compare molecular structures to determine how molecular packing affects density."
     ✓ "Evaluate evidence to determine which molecular structure allows for closer packing."

2. MEASURABLE ACTION VERBS
   - Use observable, assessable verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy
   - Avoid vague verbs: understand, know, learn, appreciate
   - Prefer concrete verbs: identify, analyze, calculate, design, evaluate, explain

3. SPECIFIC AND CLEAR
   - Each objective should target ONE specific competency
   - Include conditions when relevant: "Given X, students will..."
   - Include criteria when measurable: "...with 90% accuracy"
   - Keep objectives concise (under 140 characters preferred)

4. ABCD FORMAT (when appropriate)
   A = Audience (who: students, learners)
   B = Behavior (action verb + what they will do)
   C = Condition (context, tools, or resources provided)
   D = Degree (criteria for success)

5. SMART CRITERIA
   S = Specific (targets clear competency)
   M = Measurable (can be assessed or observed)
   A = Achievable (realistic for level and timeframe)
   R = Results-oriented (focuses on learning outcome)
   T = Time-bound (if applicable)


BLOOM'S TAXONOMY - COGNITIVE LEVELS
====================================

LEVEL 1: REMEMBER (Recall facts and basic concepts)
Verbs: define, list, identify, recall, recognize, state, name, label, match, memorize

LEVEL 2: UNDERSTAND (Explain ideas or concepts)
Verbs: explain, describe, summarize, paraphrase, classify, compare, interpret, discuss, distinguish

LEVEL 3: APPLY (Use information in new situations)
Verbs: use, solve, demonstrate, calculate, apply, predict, show, execute, implement, operate

LEVEL 4: ANALYZE (Draw connections among ideas)
Verbs: analyze, differentiate, distinguish, examine, investigate, categorize, compare, contrast, organize, deconstruct

LEVEL 5: EVALUATE (Justify a decision or course of action)
Verbs: evaluate, assess, critique, judge, justify, defend, argue, appraise, support, validate

LEVEL 6: CREATE (Produce new or original work)
Verbs: create, design, construct, develop, formulate, compose, plan, produce, invent, generate


STYLE AND FORMATTING RULES
===========================

SENTENCE STRUCTURE:
- Start with action verb in base form
- Use sentence case (capitalize first word only, unless proper nouns)
- Keep sentence structure simple and direct
- Avoid compound objectives (split into multiple if covering >1 skill)

AVOID:
- Contractions (don't, can't, won't)
- Em dashes (—) or unnecessary punctuation
- Passive voice ("will be understood" → "will explain")
- Jargon or undefined technical terms
- Multiple verbs in one objective (unless naturally grouped)

PREFER:
- Active voice
- Concrete, discipline-specific nouns
- Clear prerequisite ordering (foundational before advanced)
- Parallel structure when listing multiple objectives


STANDARDS ALIGNMENT GUIDANCE
=============================

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY:
- Default framework for most disciplines
- Align objectives to appropriate cognitive level for audience
- Progress from lower-order (remember, understand) to higher-order (analyze, evaluate, create)

NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards):
- Use for K-12 and college science courses
- Integrate three dimensions: practices, core ideas, crosscutting concepts
- Format: "Use a model to..." "Analyze data to..." "Construct an explanation..."
- Example: "NGSS HS-PS1-1: Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements"

COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS (CCSS):
- Use for ELA and Mathematics
- Match phrasing to standard language
- Include standard code when applicable
- Example: "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.11-12.4: Determine meaning of words and phrases as used in text"

ALIGNMENT FORMAT:
- If standard is clear, cite it: "[Standard Code]: [Brief description]"
- If multiple standards apply, separate with " · " or list both
- If no specific standard, return null
- Keep alignment text under 200 characters


AUDIENCE LEVEL GUIDANCE
========================

HIGH SCHOOL:
- Focus on fundamental skills and content mastery
- Use clear, accessible language
- Balance lower and mid-level Bloom's verbs (remember, understand, apply, analyze)
- Align to state standards (NGSS, CCSS) when applicable

COLLEGE (INTRODUCTORY):
- Assume foundational knowledge from high school
- Emphasize application, analysis, and some evaluation
- Use discipline-specific terminology with context
- Balance breadth and depth

COLLEGE (ADVANCED):
- Expect synthesis of multiple concepts
- Emphasize analysis, evaluation, and creation
- Use advanced discipline-specific vocabulary
- Focus on higher-order thinking and original work

GRADUATE:
- Assume deep disciplinary knowledge
- Emphasize evaluation, creation, and original research
- Use expert-level terminology
- Focus on scholarly contribution and advanced problem-solving


EXAMPLES OF WELL-WRITTEN OBJECTIVES
====================================

STRONG EXAMPLES:

✓ "Identify the types of atomic bonds present in polymers and metallic compounds."
  - Clear action verb (identify), specific content, student-centered

✓ "Calculate the density of a sample from its measured mass and displaced volume."
  - Measurable action (calculate), includes process, assessable

✓ "Given a dataset of climate trends, analyze patterns to identify evidence of long-term change."
  - Includes condition (given dataset), action verb (analyze), specific outcome

✓ "Evaluate three policy proposals for reducing carbon emissions and defend your recommendation with evidence."
  - Higher-order thinking (evaluate, defend), includes criteria (with evidence)


WEAK EXAMPLES (with fixes):

✗ "Understand photosynthesis."
  → "Explain the process of photosynthesis and describe how light energy is converted to chemical energy."
  (Changed vague "understand" to measurable "explain" and "describe")

✗ "Learn about the French Revolution."
  → "Identify and analyze the primary causes of the French Revolution."
  (Changed vague "learn about" to specific action verbs)

✗ "Cover Newton's Laws."
  → "Apply Newton's three laws of motion to solve problems involving force and acceleration."
  (Changed teacher-centered "cover" to student-centered "apply")

✗ "Students will know chemical bonding."
  → "Distinguish between ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding using electronegativity differences."
  (Changed unmeasurable "know" to specific "distinguish" with criteria)


ASSESSMENT SUGGESTIONS (when requested)
========================================

When include_assessments = true, provide brief aligned assessment ideas:
- Match cognitive level of objective
- Suggest format: quiz, problem set, lab, essay, presentation, project, etc.
- Keep under 100 characters
- Examples:
  * "Short answer: Explain process with labeled diagram."
  * "Problem set: Calculate 5 density values from lab data."
  * "Essay: Evaluate policy using criteria from rubric."

- Application and higher-order objectives later
- Cognitive progression: remember → understand → apply → analyze → evaluate → create


COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
=========================

1. TOO VAGUE: "Understand the scientific method"
   → FIX: "Describe the steps of the scientific method and apply them to design an experiment"

2. TOO BROAD: "Learn everything about World War II"
   → FIX: "Analyze the political and economic causes of World War II"

3. TEACHER-CENTERED: "Teach students about DNA replication"
   → FIX: "Students will explain the process of DNA replication and identify key enzymes involved"

4. UNMEASURABLE: "Appreciate classical music"
   → FIX: "Identify characteristics of Baroque, Classical, and Romantic music periods from listening examples"

5. MULTIPLE SKILLS: "Read, analyze, and write about climate change"
   → FIX: Split into 3 objectives (one for each skill)

7. TOO SPECIFIC TO ASSESSMENT ITEM: "Predict which polymer has higher density based on molecular structure."
  → FIX: "Compare molecular structures to determine how molecular packing affects density."
  (Generalize objective to focus on skill/concept, not specific item)

6. ACTIVITY-BASED: "Complete a lab on titration"
   → FIX: "Perform titrations to determine the concentration of an acid with 95% accuracy"
