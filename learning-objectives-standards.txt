CORE PRINCIPLES FOR HIGH-QUALITY LEARNING OBJECTIVES
====================================================

LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND ASSESSMENT MAPPING
==========================================

1. ONE OBJECTIVE, MANY QUESTIONS
  - A single learning objective can and often should be addressed by more than one assessment question or task.
  - Each objective represents a meaningful skill or concept; collect multiple pieces of evidence for that skill.
  - Example:
    - LO: "Analyze frequency distributions to determine whether a safety threshold is exceeded."
    - Questions: multiple items that ask students to identify the correct distribution, read a histogram, and interpret whether a limit has been crossed.

2. ONE QUESTION, POSSIBLY MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES
  - A single assessment question may provide evidence for more than one objective, especially at higher Bloom levels.
  - This is acceptable, but objectives should not all depend on a single item.
  - If a question touches three or more objectives, consider splitting it into simpler questions.

3. AVOID ONE-TO-ONE MAPPING
  - Do not assume "one question = one objective."
  - Each graded question must align to at least one objective.
  - Each objective must be assessed by at least one question.
  - Avoid "orphan objectives" (no questions) and "orphan questions" (no objectives).

4. DESIGN FOR EVIDENCE, NOT ITEMS
  - When generating objectives from text, focus on the underlying capability the assessment items measure.
  - Ask: "What general skill could multiple questions reasonably test here?" not "What does this exact question say?"

5. COURSE AND MODULE SCOPE
  - For course-level objectives, write statements broad enough that several assignments or exams can provide evidence.
  - Reserve very narrow, single-item skills for activity- or step-level objectives, not course-level outcomes.

CORE PRINCIPLES FOR HIGH-QUALITY LEARNING OBJECTIVES
====================================================

1. STUDENT-CENTERED FOCUS
  - Objectives must describe what students will accomplish, not what instructors will teach.
  - Preferred phrasing: "Students will be able to..." or write the outcome starting with a verb (for example, "Analyze...", "Evaluate...").
  - Avoid: "Teach X," "Cover Y," "Introduce Z."

2. ALIGNMENT WITH ASSESSMENTS AND STANDARDS
  - Every objective must be measurable through assessments or observable performance.
  - A single objective can be addressed by more than one assessment question or task.
  - Each graded question must align to at least one objective; each objective must be assessed by at least one question.
  - When standards frameworks (NGSS, CCSS, etc.) apply, tag each objective with the relevant code(s).

3. MEASURABLE ACTION VERBS
  - Use observable, assessable verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy.
  - Avoid vague verbs: understand, know, learn, appreciate.
  - Prefer concrete verbs: identify, analyze, calculate, construct, design, evaluate, explain.

4. SPECIFIC AND CLEAR
  - Each objective should target one main competency or a small set of closely related micro-skills.
  - Include conditions when relevant: "Given a dataset of groundwater samples, students will..."
  - Include criteria when appropriate: "...within 5 percent of the correct value" or "...using appropriate units."
  - Aim for concise statements (one sentence, ideally under 140 characters).

5. APPROPRIATE SCOPE AND GRANULARITY
  - Course-level objectives should be broad enough to require multiple weeks and multiple assessments.
  - Module- or act-level objectives can be narrower but should still support more than one question or activity.
  - Avoid objectives that simply restate a single, highly specific assessment item.

6. GENERALIZE BEYOND SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT ITEMS
  - Objectives should describe the skill or concept, not the specific example or question.
  - Focus on the underlying cognitive process and content, not particular names, numbers, or stories.
  - Example:
    ✗ "Predict which polymer has higher density based on molecular structure."
    ✓ "Compare molecular structures to determine how molecular packing affects density."
    ✓ "Evaluate evidence to determine which molecular structure allows for closer packing."

7. SMART AND ABCD (WHEN RELEVANT)
  - Use SMART thinking to check objectives:
    - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Results-oriented, Time-bound (if appropriate).
  - Use the ABCD frame when conditions and criteria matter:
    - A = Audience (students, learners)
    - B = Behavior (action verb + outcome)
    - C = Condition (context, tools, resources)
    - D = Degree (accuracy or performance standard)


BLOOM'S TAXONOMY - COGNITIVE LEVELS
====================================

LEVEL 1: REMEMBER (Recall facts and basic concepts)
Verbs: define, list, identify, recall, recognize, state, name, label, match, memorize

LEVEL 2: UNDERSTAND (Explain ideas or concepts)
Verbs: explain, describe, summarize, paraphrase, classify, compare, interpret, discuss, distinguish

LEVEL 3: APPLY (Use information in new situations)
Verbs: use, solve, demonstrate, calculate, apply, predict, show, execute, implement, operate

LEVEL 4: ANALYZE (Draw connections among ideas)
Verbs: analyze, differentiate, distinguish, examine, investigate, categorize, compare, contrast, organize, deconstruct

LEVEL 5: EVALUATE (Justify a decision or course of action)
Verbs: evaluate, assess, critique, judge, justify, defend, argue, appraise, support, validate

LEVEL 6: CREATE (Produce new or original work)
Verbs: create, design, construct, develop, formulate, compose, plan, produce, invent, generate


STYLE AND FORMATTING RULES
===========================

SENTENCE STRUCTURE:
- Start with action verb in base form
- Use sentence case (capitalize first word only, unless proper nouns)
- Keep sentence structure simple and direct
- Avoid compound objectives (split into multiple if covering >1 skill)

AVOID:
- Contractions (don't, can't, won't)
- Em dashes (—) or unnecessary punctuation
- Passive voice ("will be understood" → "will explain")
- Jargon or undefined technical terms
- Multiple verbs in one objective (unless naturally grouped)


PREFERRED OBJECTIVE STYLE
=========================
- When possible, begin with a condition or context (e.g., "Given X, ...")
- Follow with a measurable action verb and the concept or skill
- Avoid referencing specific assessment items or examples
- Use discipline-specific nouns and clear, direct language

EXAMPLES:
✓ "Given a frequency distribution (e.g., histogram), estimate the proportion of data above a certain threshold."
✓ "Predict the type of quantitative evidence needed to justify a claim about the expected value of a variable."
✓ "Given evidence and a claim, determine whether the evidence supports the claim."
✓ "Identify an element on the periodic table using its atomic number or number of protons."
✓ "Given an element’s symbol, use a periodic table to determine its atomic number."
✓ "Determine the group number of an element based on its name, symbol, or atomic number."
✓ "Classify an element as a metal, metalloid, or nonmetal based on its position within the periodic table."
✓ "Predict an element’s tendency to lose or gain electrons based on its position within the periodic table."
✓ "Determine the number of valence electrons of an element based on its position within the periodic table."


STANDARDS ALIGNMENT GUIDANCE
=============================

BLOOM'S TAXONOMY:
- Default framework for most disciplines
- Align objectives to appropriate cognitive level for audience
- Progress from lower-order (remember, understand) to higher-order (analyze, evaluate, create)

NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards):
- Use for K-12 and college science courses
- Integrate three dimensions: practices, core ideas, crosscutting concepts
- Format: "Use a model to..." "Analyze data to..." "Construct an explanation..."
- Example: "NGSS HS-PS1-1: Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements"
- When aligning to NGSS, cite the performance expectation code (for example, HS-PS1-1) and paraphrase the intent in your own words.
- Do not reproduce long blocks of standards text inside the objective. Use the objective for student-facing language and the standard code for alignment metadata.

COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS (CCSS):
- Use for ELA and Mathematics
- Match phrasing to standard language
- Include standard code when applicable
- Example: "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.11-12.4: Determine meaning of words and phrases as used in text"

ALIGNMENT FORMAT:
- If standard is clear, cite it: "[Standard Code]: [Brief description]"
- If multiple standards apply, separate with " · " or list both
- If no specific standard, return null
- Keep alignment text under 200 characters


AUDIENCE LEVEL GUIDANCE
========================

HIGH SCHOOL:
- Focus on fundamental skills and content mastery
- Use clear, accessible language
- Balance lower and mid-level Bloom's verbs (remember, understand, apply, analyze)
- Align to state standards (NGSS, CCSS) when applicable

COLLEGE (INTRODUCTORY):
- Assume foundational knowledge from high school
- Emphasize application, analysis, and some evaluation
- Use discipline-specific terminology with context
- Balance breadth and depth

COLLEGE (ADVANCED):
- Expect synthesis of multiple concepts
- Emphasize analysis, evaluation, and creation
- Use advanced discipline-specific vocabulary
- Focus on higher-order thinking and original work

GRADUATE:
- Assume deep disciplinary knowledge
- Emphasize evaluation, creation, and original research
- Use expert-level terminology
- Focus on scholarly contribution and advanced problem-solving


EXAMPLES OF WELL-WRITTEN OBJECTIVES
====================================

STRONG EXAMPLES:

✓ "Identify the types of atomic bonds present in polymers and metallic compounds."
  - Clear action verb (identify), specific content, student-centered

✓ "Calculate the density of a sample from its measured mass and displaced volume."
  - Measurable action (calculate), includes process, assessable

✓ "Given a dataset of climate trends, analyze patterns to identify evidence of long-term change."
  - Includes condition (given dataset), action verb (analyze), specific outcome

✓ "Evaluate three policy proposals for reducing carbon emissions and defend your recommendation with evidence."
  - Higher-order thinking (evaluate, defend), includes criteria (with evidence)


WEAK EXAMPLES (with fixes):

✗ "Understand photosynthesis."
  → "Explain the process of photosynthesis and describe how light energy is converted to chemical energy."
  (Changed vague "understand" to measurable "explain" and "describe")

✗ "Learn about the French Revolution."
  → "Identify and analyze the primary causes of the French Revolution."
  (Changed vague "learn about" to specific action verbs)

✗ "Cover Newton's Laws."
  → "Apply Newton's three laws of motion to solve problems involving force and acceleration."
  (Changed teacher-centered "cover" to student-centered "apply")

✗ "Students will know chemical bonding."
  → "Distinguish between ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding using electronegativity differences."
  (Changed unmeasurable "know" to specific "distinguish" with criteria)


ASSESSMENT SUGGESTIONS (when requested)
========================================

When include_assessments = true, provide brief aligned assessment ideas:
- Match cognitive level of objective
- Suggest format: quiz, problem set, lab, essay, presentation, project, etc.
- Keep under 100 characters
- Examples:
  * "Short answer: Explain process with labeled diagram."
  * "Problem set: Calculate 5 density values from lab data."
  * "Essay: Evaluate policy using criteria from rubric."


METADATA AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
=================================

RESPONSE SCHEMA:
{
  "learning_objectives": [
    {
      "id": "LO1",
      "objective_text": "<objective with action verb>",
      "alignment": "<standard or null>"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "audience_level": "<high_school|college_intro|college_advanced|graduate>",
    "subject_area": "<subject or null>",
    "framework": "<bloom|ngss|ccss>",
    "source_file_ids": [],
    "generated_at": "<ISO8601>"
  }
}

ID NUMBERING:
- Use sequential: LO1, LO2, LO3, ..., LO20
- Maintain order in instructional sequence

ORDERING:
- Foundational objectives first (prerequisite knowledge)
- Application and higher-order objectives later
- Cognitive progression: remember → understand → apply → analyze → evaluate → create
- For course-level documents, generate a small, coherent set of objectives (for example, 4 to 12) that cover the major skills and concepts.
- Merge near-duplicate outcomes rather than producing many tiny objectives that differ only in wording.


COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
=========================

1. TOO VAGUE: "Understand the scientific method"
   → FIX: "Describe the steps of the scientific method and apply them to design an experiment"

2. TOO BROAD: "Learn everything about World War II"
   → FIX: "Analyze the political and economic causes of World War II"

3. TEACHER-CENTERED: "Teach students about DNA replication"
   → FIX: "Students will explain the process of DNA replication and identify key enzymes involved"

4. UNMEASURABLE: "Appreciate classical music"
   → FIX: "Identify characteristics of Baroque, Classical, and Romantic music periods from listening examples"

5. MULTIPLE SKILLS: "Read, analyze, and write about climate change"
   → FIX: Split into 3 objectives (one for each skill)

6. TOO SPECIFIC TO ONE ITEM
  → FIX: Rewrite the objective so that it describes the general skill (for example, "Compare molecular structures to determine how packing affects density"), not a single question or example.

7. ACTIVITY-BASED: "Complete a lab on titration"
  → FIX: "Perform titrations to determine the concentration of an acid with 95% accuracy"
