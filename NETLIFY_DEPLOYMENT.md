# ðŸš€ Alternative Deployment Guide - Netlify Functions

Since Vercel's free plan has authentication protection that's blocking your API, let's use Netlify Functions instead - it's free and doesn't have these restrictions.

## âš¡ Quick Deployment with Netlify

### Step 1: Install Netlify CLI

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Netlify

```bash
netlify login
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify

```bash
# Copy the netlify package.json over the main one
copy package-netlify.json package.json

# Deploy
netlify deploy
```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variable

```bash
netlify env:set OPENAI_API_KEY your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

### Step 5: Production Deploy

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 6: Update Your Website

After deployment, Netlify will give you a URL like: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

Update the API endpoint in your `app.js`:

```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
    endpoint: 'https://your-actual-netlify-url.netlify.app/api',
    apiKey: null
};
```

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Manual Netlify Dashboard Setup

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login**
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Configure:**
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `./`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
5. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - Key: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: `your-api-key-here`
6. **Deploy**

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your API

Once deployed, your API will be available at:
`https://your-site.netlify.app/api/generate-descriptions`

## ðŸ’¡ Why Netlify is Better for This Use Case

- âœ… **No authentication protection** on free plan
- âœ… **Free functions** with generous limits
- âœ… **Easy GitHub integration**
- âœ… **Automatic deployments**
- âœ… **Built-in CORS support**
- âœ… **Environment variables** included free

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Cost

- **Netlify:** Completely free for your usage level
- **OpenAI API:** ~$0.01-0.03 per image analysis
- **Total monthly:** Likely under $5 for educational use

This approach will solve your authentication issues and get your accessibility tool working immediately!
