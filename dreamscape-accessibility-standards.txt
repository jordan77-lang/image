DREAMSCAPE LEARN ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS

This document provides institutional standards for creating accessible image content that aligns with Dreamscape Learn curriculum requirements.

=== ALT TEXT STANDARDS ===

Character Limit: 120 characters maximum
- Count only visible characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, spaces)
- Do not count quotation marks unless part of actual alt text

Language Requirements:
- Use active voice and present tense
- Use "to" instead of hyphens in numeric ranges (e.g., "5 to 6" not "5-6")
- Spell out all units in full (e.g., "milligrams per liter" not "mg/L")
- Use "frequency distribution" instead of "bar chart" or "histogram"

Content Guidelines:
- Describe only what is visually present
- Include essential visual information for understanding
- Avoid redundant phrases like "image of" or "picture showing"
- Focus on educational content and key data points

=== FIGURE DESCRIPTION STANDARDS ===

Structure (Kroodsma Style):
1. Begin with take-home message (main finding or insight)
2. Follow with supporting details giving clear context
3. Include variables, comparisons, patterns and their connections
4. Make description stand-alone and fully communicative

Requirements:
- Use full sentences, no fragments or bullet points
- Keep language plain and accessible
- Explain what relationships mean, don't just list what figure shows
- Length: 1-3 sentences (typically up to 50 words, but may exceed for clarity)
- NEVER begin with "Figure #." - start directly with scientific content
- Do NOT end with generic purpose sentences like "This figure allows you to evaluate..."

Examples:
- Good: "Arsenic's position in the periodic table reveals its chemical reactivity and similarity to nearby elements."
- Poor: "Periodic table with arsenic highlighted."

=== LONG DESCRIPTION STANDARDS ===

Format:
- Always begin with: "This image is a [type] showing..."
- Use plain language and short clauses
- Emphasize educational takeaway: trend, relationship, or concept the image teaches

Content Requirements:
- Focus on educational significance and learning objectives
- Use "to" for numeric ranges instead of hyphens
- Spell out all units in full (no abbreviations)
- Use "frequency distribution" not "bar chart" or "histogram"
- Never restate paragraph text or captions

=== TRANSCRIBED TEXT STANDARDS ===

Accuracy:
- Transcribe all visible text in logical reading order
- Preserve spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and unit abbreviations exactly as shown
- Include axis labels, legends, titles, and data values

Special Cases:
- For frequency distributions: List each bin's range exactly as shown followed by bar height
- Put each "range: frequency" pair on separate line
- Include bins with zero height if labeled on axis
- If no text visible, write "No text visible in image"

=== QUALITY CHECKLIST ===

Before finalizing accessibility content, verify:
- Alt text is â‰¤120 characters
- Figure description starts with take-home message
- Long description begins with "This image is a..."
- All units are spelled out in full
- Numeric ranges use "to" format
- Language is clear and educationally focused
- Content supports learning objectives
